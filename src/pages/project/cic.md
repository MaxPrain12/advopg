During my tenure at [IDboxRT](https://idboxrt.com/es/), I had the opportunity to be an integral part of the monitoring team. My primary role consisted of carrying out programming tasks focused on the BackEnd of the application, employing programming languages like C# and Java. In addition, I used tools such as [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) for computer equipment monitoring.

Occasionally, I would resort to additional programming languages such as Python, Bash, and PowerShell, which allowed me to create customized monitoring in [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/). Within the department, I was also a member of the DevOps group, where we carried out a variety of tasks, ranging from managing environments in the cloud, administering domains and firewalls, to network administration.

This period at [IDboxRT](https://idboxrt.com/es/) was a valuable opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge in programming and monitoring systems.
