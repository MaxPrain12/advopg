For my final study project, I decided to embark on the creation of Shotshare, an innovative multi-platform social network application. This project was an opportunity to apply and demonstrate all the skills and knowledge I had acquired throughout my studies.

Shotshare is composed of three main components:

1. A Rest API developed with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en). This API serves as the BackEnd of the application and stores user information in a relational database using [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). Additionally, I implemented [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), an advanced production process management system, to ensure that the application is always active.

2. The application's FrontEnd was developed using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/). I chose this framework due to my familiarity with it through its use in my studies. I leveraged its potential to create a feature-rich interface, which includes the possibility for users to post games based on [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL).

3. Finally, I designed a mobile application using [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/). This cross-platform development tool allowed me to efficiently inherit the work already done on the desktop application for the mobile version. I also implemented additional security measures to ensure that the application complied with the standards required by Android and iOS for app publishing.

In addition, I acquired the Shotshare.es domain through [IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/?ar=1) and used [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/es-es/) to redirect traffic to the application from a local machine. On the BackEnd, high and low-quality images are stored and displayed according to the user's context in the application.

I am very proud of this project, as it is the direct result of all the knowledge and skills I acquired during my training.
